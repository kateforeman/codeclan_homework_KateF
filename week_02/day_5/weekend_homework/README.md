#cleaned_data.R 

In this R script the raw meteorite data was read into Rstudio. The data was cleaned in this script using janitor and tidyverse. The dataframe was converted to a CSV so it was ready to be read in elsewhere. The "geolocation" column was split into "latitude" and "longitude" and missing data fields were replaced with 0's. 

#cleaned_data.RMD 

In this R notebook, the clean data from the R script was read in. The names and years of the largest meteorites were found. The average mean for those seen falling versus those just found were calculated. The number of meteorites in every year since 2000 were found. 

#meteorite_landings.csv 

This is the raw data before it has been cleaned.
